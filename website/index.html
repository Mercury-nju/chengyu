                    <h2>The Problem We See</h2>
                    <p>In this age of information overload, our attention is constantly fought over by countless apps. Short videos, social media, instant messaging... they're meticulously designed to be irresistible.</p>
                    <p>We find ourselves increasingly unable to focus, increasingly anxious. Our brains are exhausted from high dopamine stimulation, and our psychological stability gradually crumbles.</p>
                </div>

                    <h2>Our Thinking</h2>
                    <p>The problem isn't technology itself, but that we've lost connection with our inner selves.</p>
                    <p>We need an "anchor," a tool that can help us return to the present and rebuild psychological stability. Not to escape the digital world, but to find balance within it.</p>

                    <h2>The Birth of Lumea</h2>
                    <p>Lumea means "a clear realm of the mind."</p>
                    <p>We've created a fluid light sphere that changes with your mental state—when you're stable, it breathes calmly; when you're anxious, it fluctuates violently. It's a mirror of your inner self.</p>
                    <p>Through four mindfulness practices, you can gradually build psychological stability, combat cognitive load, and regain control of your attention.</p>

                    <p>To help everyone find inner peace and strength in the digital age.</p>
                    <p>Not to make you give up your phone, but to make you the master of your own attention.</p>
